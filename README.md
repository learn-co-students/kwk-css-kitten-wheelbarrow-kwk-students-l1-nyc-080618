`# CSS Kitten Wheelbarrow

All the kittens have escaped our wheelbarrow. Help collect all the kittens into
the wheelbarrow using CSS selectors!

## Steps

1. Open `index.html` in the browser.
2. Use the comments in **css/place-kitty.css** to write the correct selectors to
move each kitty into the wheelbarrow.

Check `index.html` to make sure they're all safely collected!
